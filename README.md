# Football Transfers Project

This project provides tools for managing and analyzing football transfer data, including player contracts, team squads, tactical configurations, and transfer history.

## Project Structure

The project consists of four main Python scripts:

- `contracts.py`: Handles player contract data.
- `squads.py`: Manages team squad information.
- `tactics.py`: Analyzes tactical configurations of teams.
- `transfers.py`: Manages transfer history and data updates.

## Running the Scripts

Each script can be run with two modes:
- **populate**: To initialize/populate the data files on the first run.
- **update**: To update the existing data files with new information.

### Usage

```bash
python <file_name.py> <parameter>

### Examples
python squads.py: update the teams for current season.
```
